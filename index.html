  <h5 class="para-padding-32">Hi.I am Swayam.I am a first-year student currently pursing my undergraduate course at BITS-PILANI,Goa Campus.This being my first project under CTE course,I would love to have feedback from our instructers. </h5>

      <p class="para-text-grey">Taking about Web-Design and Web-Devloptment, it has always been my greatest fascination to learn these skills and contribute.Apart from Web-Dev, i even love problem-solving and practise competitive programming as another skill.I love watching cricket and consider myself a decent player.I am someone who loves travelling and trying out new food.Apart of all these,I do love to watch movies and TV series when i am free.I believe being willing to learn new things and implement has been on rof my biggest strength and I look forward to learn more in my journrey at BITS.  </p>

   <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
  <h5 class="para-padding-32">This has been a new kind of experience having working on a small yet my first project.Taking more about this project,this home page is not what i can take credit of creating.This home page is just a template,with some additions and changes from my end.Instructors should only consider the "About Me" page as my actual project which has been entirely developed by me. </h5>

  <p class="para-text-grey">This page is mostly built using HTML and CSS styling.I have used JS at place which includes,a short word script that has been timed to print each word at a time-space of 100ms.Also I have added a bit of CSS animations which can be seen in the small animated logos.Bootstrap really helped me animate my skill bar and I just had to design the styling.Other than that I have only used standard HTML and CSS styling to build this Webpage. </p>
